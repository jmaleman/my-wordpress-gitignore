# My WordPress gitignore
This is my own version of gitignore based on official WordPress template gitignore at [Github](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/WordPress.gitignore).

## Motivation ✨
I always feel the need to update the .gitignore file, and honestly, it's kind of boring. (It's something I should have done a long time ago, and if you haven't done it yet, I recommend you do 😉).
